# The Homebrew formula for Algol-24.
#
# Lives here so it is versioned with the thing it packages; the tap that serves
# it is a separate repository, github.com/schildawg/homebrew-algol24, whose
# Formula/algol24.rb is a copy of this file with the url and sha256 for the
# release being published.
#
# ⚠️ NO dependency block, and that is not an oversight.  A --ffi build links
# against /usr/lib/libffi.dylib -- the system one, shipped with macOS -- so the
# bottle needs nothing beyond the operating system.  A Linux formula would have
# to declare libffi instead, which is one reason this tap bottles for macOS
# alone.
#
# ⚠️ Naming that library in the ordinary way, even inside a comment, fails
# 'brew style': the audit reads it as a dependency someone commented out, and
# an explanation of why a formula has none looks exactly like one.
